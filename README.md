HEY GUYS THIS IS A CODE FOR STACK IMPLEMENTATION USING ARRAY DATA STRUCTURE.
BEFORE USING ARRAY FOR CREATING A STACK YOU MUST HAVE SOME PREQUISITE KNOWLEDGE LIKE:
IN STACK INSERTION OF ELEMENTS TAKE PLACE FROM FRONTEND AND DELETION TAKE PLACE FROM REAREND.
ALIKE HEAD POINTER IN LINKED LIST STACK TOO HAVE A POINTER CALLED"TOP" WHICH POINTS TO THE TOP MOST ELEMENT OF THE STACK.
TAKE TOP INITIAL/DEFAULT VALUE AS -1 SINCE IT INCREMENT BY 1 DURING INSERTION AND DECREMENTS BY 1 DURING DELETION. 
STACK UNDEFLOW:THIS OCCURS WHEN TOP=-1 AND WE ARE PERFORMING POP OPERATION.
STACK OVERFLOW:LET ARRAY SIZE IS 5 AND WE ARE ABOUT TO PERFORM PUSH OPERATION FOR 6TH TIME IN THIS CASE WE GET STACK OVERFLOW.
